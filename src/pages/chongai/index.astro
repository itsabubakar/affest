          AFFEST 2025 Theme: The Chongai Soigné; Cheering on in Southern Colours.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 sm:text-xl">
          This year, AFFEST takes a deliberate and dignified journey home, to the resilient and
          radiant heart of Southern Kaduna.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 sm:text-xl">
          “Chongai” is more than a word. It is identity. It is ancestry. It is a declaration of
          pride for anyone with Southern Kaduna roots. It reflects a people known for their
          hospitality, strength, creativity and rich cultural depth.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 sm:text-xl">
          “Soigné” meaning polished and elegant, represents the grace, dignity and style that define
          the Chongai people. When paired, Chongai Soigné becomes an ode to the sophisticated spirit
          of Southern Kaduna, expressed through our fabrics, food, language and lived experiences.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base font-semibold text-primary-950/70 sm:text-xl">
          Cheering on in Southern Colours
        </p>
        <p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 sm:text-xl">
          We cheer on in Green, indigo, terracotta, sunset golds and earth tones, the colours of our
          land, our stories and our survival. These colours are not just aesthetic, they are
          ancestral. They trace back to the ancient artistry of the NOK culture, one of the earliest
          known civilizations in sub-Saharan Africa, located right here in Southern Kaduna.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 sm:text-xl">
          The NOK culture, with its world-renowned terracotta sculptures, reveals that long before
          modern tools, Chongai ancestors were artists, visionaries and builders of beauty. Their
          art spoke of community, identity and power. The values we still hold dear.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 sm:text-xl">
          This year, AFFEST becomes a living canvas where ancient artistry meets modern elegance.
          We’re telling our stories, wearing our truths and selling our crafts, without shame,
          without filter and without apology.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base font-semibold text-primary-950/70 sm:text-xl">

          To Be Chongai Is To Be Enough.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base text-primary-950/70 sm:text-xl">
